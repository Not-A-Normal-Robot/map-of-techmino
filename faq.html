    Techmino has received a warning about Copyright infringement from The Tetris Company.
    Techmino is no longer available on the App Store.
    <br>
    A TestFlight was made for Techmino, but unfortunately, the maximum number of members
    had been reached, and therefore, you can't download Techmino on iOS anymore.
    We apologize for the inconvenience. If it says the beta isn't accepting more testers,
    unfortunately, it is not available at this time.

        Find the version you want to install on this page, and then download “Techmino_iOS.ipa”.
    </li>
    <li>

            <p>If you want to install a version of Techmino that has no ipa builds, you can follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Get the .ipa files from <a href="https://github.com/26F-Studio/Techmino/releases">the GitHub releases page</a>. Find any version with a valid .ipa file, then download “Techmino_iOS.ipa”.</li>
    <li>Change the extension of the .ipa file to .zip. Extract the .zip file.</li>
    <li>Go to ./Payload. If you are using Microsoft Windows, you will see a folder named “Techmino.app”. Open that folder and skip to step 5.</li>
    <li>If you are using macOS, you will see an application file named Techmino.app. Control-click on it, then click on “Show package content” in the context menu.</li>
    <li>Locate game.love. Replace this file using the .love file you intend to install.</li>
    <li>Compress the Techmino iOS file into a .zip file again. Please choose the “no compression” option in your archive app when creating this zip file.</li>
    <li>Change the extension of the new .zip file back to .ipa.</li>
    <li>Follow the instructions of the previous FAQ entry.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that builds that are too far back in time may use a different build of LÖVE and may not work properly with this method.</p>

    On 15 Jan, 2022, MrZ (the main dev of Techmino) opened an issue named “REMAKE NOW” on the GitHub page.
    According to MrZ himself, the current Techmino contains too many bugs that he needs to remake the whole game
    from scratch in order to resolve them.
    <br>
    Although it's still far from complete, you can view the source code <a href="https://github.com/26F-Studio/Techmino_Galaxy">here</a>.

            How can I play Techmino: Galaxy (the remake)?

            <p>
    <em>Do understand that Galaxy is still rather early in development,
    and does not necessarily give the best experience.</em>
    <br> <br>
    The easiest way to obtain Techmino: Galaxy is through GitHub Actions. <br>
    (note: you need a GitHub account to download artifacts in GitHub Actions.)
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Go to <a href="https://github.com/26F-Studio/Techmino_Galaxy/actions">Techmino Galaxy's Actions page.</a></li>
    <li>
        Select one workflow run from the list. <br>
        A green tick mark means this run has successfully built all versions without errors. <br>
        A red cross means there were some errors, but doesn't necessarily mean your version wasn't built successfully.
    </li>
    <li>
        Scroll down to "Artifacts" and download your desired platform's version,
        or scroll further down to "Post-build summary" for links to mirrors to download from.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Alternatively, obtain the source code and Love2D binary separately,
    and use the Love2D binary to open the source code.
    <br>
    To do this, follow these instructions:
</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="https://love2d.org/">Get the latest version of LÖVE</a>.</li>
    <li>Download the repo from GitHub (or just run a quick <code>git clone https://github.com/26F-Studio/Techmino_Galaxy.git</code> if you have Git installed).</li>
    <li>
        Check if the Zenitha folder is empty. If it is, clone <a href="https://github.com/26F-Studio/Zenitha">Zenitha</a>
        and put everything inside the folder into Zenitha in Techmino_Galaxy.</li>
    <li>Drag and drop the entire Techmino_Galaxy folder onto love.exe (or love.app, depending on your OS)</li>
</ol>

<p>
    Also, if you often update the game, consider following <a href="https://github.com/26F-Studio/Techmino_Galaxy/discussions/26">this guide made by SweetSea</a>.
    <br>
    Note: MrZ does not recommend talking about Techmino: Galaxy's contents,
    especially things that can still change a lot, in public places. <br>
    Unless you have otherwise a good reason, might as well respect his recommendation. Thank you!

    You need to play it in order to unlock the other modes.
    Lines coming out from mode icons indicate whether this mode can unlock other modes.
    To unlock subsequent modes, you need to reach at least B rank on the mode — this would be
    1m 2s for Sprint 10L, or 3m 3s for Sprint 40L.

    Close, but no.
    Some more important differences from Guideline are:
    it defaults to a custom rotation system that is based on SRS but has more kicks, has all spin and O-spin.
    This game also has a different attack table.

        <li><a href="https://github.com/MinusKelvin/cold-clear">Cold Clear is developed by MinusKelvin</a>.
            It is capable of performing T-Spins, Back-to-Backs and Perfect Clears.

    The game has an anti-addiction system that prevents playing for too long.
    It only takes into effect if you're playing the game in Chinese with a Sprint 10L time of over 10s,
    a Sprint 40L time of over 32.6s, and you have been playing for 4 hours.
    The timer resets on midnight.
    Although this feature isn't required because the game hasn't been registered in China,
    it's still a pretty cool Easter egg.

    Try plugging and unplugging your keyboard, or reconnecting your keyboard

    This kind of issue typically only happens on mobile devices.
    For iOS and iPadOS users, that is an issue we can not fix for now.
    This might be related to the iOS distro of LÖVE or how iOS recognises external keyboards.
    At the same time, you can still use the on-screen virtual keys.

            <p>
    First, go to our <a href="https://github.com/26F-Studio/Techmino/">GitHub repo</a>,
    then navigate to <code>/parts/modes</code> to find the mode file (<code>.lua</code>) you want to open. <br>
    After that, look for a piece of the code that looks like this (this will going to be different for each mode;
        this example uses <code>sprint_40l.lua</code>): <br>
    <pre>
        <code>
if P.stat.row<40 then return end
local T=P.stat.time
return
    T<=26 and 5 or
    T<=36 and 4 or
    T<=52.6 and 3 or
    T<=92.9 and 2 or
    T<=183 and 1 or
    0
end,</code></pre>
    <br>
    The first line means that if <code>P.stat.row</code> is less than 40 (which means that you didn’t finish the 40L sprint), your grade is not recorded. <br>
    The variable’s name that goes after <code>local</code> is the category of the requirement (in this example, time (in seconds)). <br>
    The <code>5</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>1</code> correspond to <code>X</code>, <code>U</code>, <code>S</code>, <code>A</code>, and <code>B</code> grades in the game.
    <code>0</code> also means your grade is not recorded (in this example, when your time exceeds 183 seconds).

        <p>There are two kinds of O-spins: transformative O-spins and translational O-spins. Transformative O-spins are only possible with TRS, while translational O-spins are possible with TRS, BiRS, and ASC; so make sure you have the correct rotation system.
        <br>To perform a transformative O-spin, move the O block in an appropriate “hole,” then use the following rotations to do the trick:
        <br><pre><code>
O → Z: LRL
O → S: RLR
O → J: LLR
O → L: RRL
O → T: LLL & RRR
O → I: FFF

<table class='compact'><tr>
    <td>
        <p>To perform a translational O-spin, you can use the fact that some rotation systems have kicks, and use that to put the O-piece in a hole. A notable oddity is BiRS, where you have to hold the correct arrow keys (move left/right/soft drop) to try to "bias" the kick in that direction, and then trying to rotate the O-piece. More info is available in the in-game Zictionary.</p>

    If you really want to test out the latest features of Techmino, the <a href="https://github.com/26F-Studio/Techmino/actions">GitHub CI</a>
    would generate a snapshot version of the app for every commit.
    Note that the snapshot versions might be unstable and contain many bugs,
    and that you need to be logged in to your GitHub account to download the artifacts (game builds). <br>
    If you want to test them out on iOS devices, you need to install the <code>.ipa</code> files manually.

    Unfortunately, the ARM distros of Linux are not yet supported by LÖVE, so you cannot do that.
    If you really want to play it on your device, we recommend you to use box64/box86 with Wine
    to run the Windows distro of the game.
    Note that you cannot open .AppImage files using box64/86 directly.

    Yes! LÖVE supports M1 Macs.
    If you are using older versions that don’t support M1, just use Rosetta 2
    (which is built within the system so you don’t have to do anything).

        <article>
            <p>
    Apparently, this is a bug that happens in iOS.
    The “Portrait” mode in settings seems to do nothing on iOS.
    Therefore, the only solution is to enter Techmino in landscape mode:
</p> <br>
<ol>
    <li>
        Swipe up from the bottom of the screen or double-tap the home button to enter App Switcher,
        then swipe up to quit Techmino.
    </li>
    <li>
        Disable the rotation lock if you haven’t already.
    </li>
    <li>
        Rotate your device to landscape mode.
        It is okay if the contents on the home screen don’t seem to be rotated to landscape view — this is normal
        as long as you hold the device in a landscape manner.
    </li>
    <li>Enter Techmino. Everything should be okay now.</li>
</ol> <br>
<p>Note that if you “swipe quit” the app again, you may need to repeat the procedure above.</p>

    Touch screen controls work slightly differently from the original Techmino,

        On this screen, you can add, remove, move, resize buttons

    Probably never. According to MrZ:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        … I don't plan to do [Tech League right now]…
        The previous system is not good as expected,
        if I want to do it I will rather add it to Techmino Galaxy…
        When I finish that, [I] will change the old button to an ad [for Techmino Galaxy’s “League”].
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Key takeaway: Tech League will be implemented in Techmino Galaxy in the future.
    It will not be implemented in the “Classic” Techmino.
