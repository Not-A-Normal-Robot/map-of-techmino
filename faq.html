        <div class="answer">
            <p>You need to play it in order to unlock the other modes. Lines coming out from mode icons indicate whether this mode can unlock other modes. To unlock subsequent modes, you need to reach at least B rank on the mode - this would be 1m 2s for Sprint 10L, or 3m 3s for Sprint 40L.</p>

        <div class="answer">
            <p>The game has an anti-addiction system that prevents playing for too long. It only takes into effect if you're playing the game in Chinese with a Sprint 10L time of over 10s, a Sprint 40L time of over 32.6s, and you have been playing for 4 hours. The timer resets on midnight. Although this feature isn't required because the game hasn't been registered in China, it's still a pretty cool Easter egg.</p>

            <p>Try plugging and unplugging your keyboard, or reconnecting your keyboard if you are using a Bluetooth keyboard. This kind of issue typically only happens on mobile devices. For iOS and iPadOS users, that is an issue we can not fix for now. This might be related to the iOS distro of LÖVE or how iOS recognises external keyboards. At the same time, you can still use the on-screen virtual keys.</p>

To do this, follow these instructions:</p><ol><li><a href="https://love2d.org/">Get the latest version of LÖVE</a>.</li><li>Download the repo from GitHub (or just run a quick <code>git clone https://github.com/26F-Studio/Techmino_Galaxy.git</code> if you have Git installed).</li><li>Check if the Zenitha folder is empty. If it is, clone <a href="https://github.com/26F-Studio/Zenitha">Zenitha</a> and put everything inside the folder into Zenitha in Techmino_Galaxy.</li><li>Drag and drop the entire Techmino_Galaxy folder onto love.exe (or love.app, depending on your OS)</li></ol><p>Also, if you often update the game, consider following <a href="https://github.com/26F-Studio/Techmino_Galaxy/discussions/26">this guide made by SweetSea</a>.</p><p>Note: MrZ does not recommend talking about Techmino: Galaxy's contents, especially things that can still change a lot, in public places.

            <p>First, go to our <a href="https://github.com/26F-Studio/Techmino/">GitHub repo</a>, then navigate to <code>/parts/modes</code> to find the mode file (<code>.lua</code>) you want to open. After that, look for a piece of the code that looks like this (this will going to be different for each mode; this example uses <code>sprint_40l.lua</code>):<br><pre><code>if P.stat.row<40 then return end
local T=P.stat.time
    return
        T<=26 and 5 or
        T<=36 and 4 or
        T<=52.6 and 3 or
        T<=92.9 and 2 or
        T<=183 and 1 or
        0
end,</pre></code><br>The first line means that if <code>P.stat.row</code> is less than 40 (which means that you didn’t finish the 40L sprint), your grade is not recorded. <br> The variable’s name that goes after <code>local</code> is the category of the requirement (in this example, time (in seconds)). <br> The <code>5</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>1</code> correspond to <code>X</code>, <code>U</code>, <code>S</code>, <code>A</code>, and <code>B</code> grades in the game. <code>0</code> also means your grade is not recorded (in this example, when your time exceeds 183 seconds). <p>

        </button>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>There are two kinds of O-spins: transformative O-spins and translational O-spins. Transformative O-spins are only possible with TRS, while translational O-spins are possible with TRS, BiRS, and ASC; so make sure you have the correct rotation system. <br> To perform a transformative O-spin, move the O block in an appropriate “hole,” then use the following rotations to do the trick:<br><pre><code>O → Z: LRL
O → S: RLR
O → J: LLR
O → L: RRL
O → T: LLL & RRR
O → I: FFF</pre></code><br> Here is a useful GIF demonstrating this: <img src="/data/trs-tf-ospin.gif"> <br> To perform a translational O-spin, you can use the fact that some rotation systems have kicks, and use that to put the O-piece in a hole. A notable oddity is BiRS, where you have to hold the correct arrow keys (move left/right/soft drop) to try to "bias" the kick in that direction, and then trying to rotate the O-piece. More info is available in the in-game Zictionary. Here's a demonstration of translational O-spins: <img src="/data/birs-tl-ospin.gif"> <br> Quick note: you may hold the transformed O block, and it will stay as the transformed block. However, if you perform a spin using this “O block,” it still counts as an O-spin.</p>

        </button>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Unfortunately, the ARM distros of Linux are not yet supported by LÖVE, so you cannot do that. If you really want to play it on your device, we recommend you to use box64/box86 with Wine to run the Windows distro of the game. Note that you cannot open .AppImage files using box64/86 directly.</p>

            <p>Yes! LÖVE supports M1 Macs. If you are using older versions that don’t support M1, just use Rosetta 2 (which is built within the system so you don’t have to do anything).</p>

        <div class="answer">
            <p>Apparently, this is a bug that happens in iOS. The “Portrait” mode in settings seems to do nothing on iOS. Therefore, the only solution is to enter Techmino in landscape mode:</p><br><ol><li>Swipe up from the bottom of the screen or double-tap the home button to enter App Switcher, then swipe up to quit Techmino.</li><li>Disable the rotation lock if you haven’t already.</li><li>Rotate your device to landscape mode. It is okay if the contents on the home screen don’t seem to be rotated to landscape view — this is normal as long as you hold the device in a landscape manner.</li><li>Enter Techmino. Everything should be okay now.</li></ol><br><p>Note that if you “swipe quit” the app again, you may need to repeat the procedures above all over again.</p>
