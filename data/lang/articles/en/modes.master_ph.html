Master PHANTASM is a unique mode of the Master modes,
featuring several unique challenges other than plain 20G and invisible.  

<h2>Sections</h2>

Master PHANTASM consists of 9 sections.

<h3>Section 1 - 0 ~ 11 points</h3>
In this section, you are forced to clear 3 Techrashes in a row. <br>
If you fail to meet this requirement, the game ends prematurely.

<h3>Section 2 - 12 ~ 25 points</h3>
In this section, the Z/S and J/L pieces' colors are swapped. <br>
This makes it easier to mistake those pieces with its mirror.

<h3>Section 3 - 26 ~ 41 points</h3>
In this section, 10 lines of garbage appear. <br>
This isn't your usual multiplayer cheese garbage; it's closer to the "Type B" kind of garbage. <br>
Significantly less garbage blocks appear the lower your stack is when you enter this section. <br>
If you enter this section without using hold up to this point, you get an extra life as a reward. <br>
You are required to clear all 10 rows of garbage to continue.

<h3>Section 4 - 42 ~ 61 points</h3>
This section is a regular 20G + bone blocks section. The Hold mechanic is also disabled. Not much to say here.

<h3>Section 5 - 62 ~ 125 points</h3>
This section disables move-reset, making it harder to survive. The speed here is comparable to the middle stages of Master FINAL.

<h3>Section 6 - 126 ~ 161 points</h3>
The game speeds up significantly in this section. Not much else changes.

<h3>Section 7 - 162 ~ 225 points</h3>
The game speeds up even more in this section. <br>
The Hold mechanic is re-enabled. <br>
Placed blocks fade away slowly.

<h3>Section 8 - 226 ~ 258 points</h3>
The bone block mechanic is disabled in this section. <br>
Placed blocks fade away faster.

<h3>Section 9 - 259 ~ 260 points</h3>
The pieces' colors are randomized upon entering this section. <br>
Placed blocks fade away nearly instantly. <br>
You have to clear 8 more Techrashes to finally finish the mode. <br>
You don't have to clear the Techrashes in a row; unlike the first section, getting any other kind of line clear doesn't end the game prematurely.
